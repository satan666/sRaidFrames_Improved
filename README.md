## PERFORMANCE ISSUES
- close WOW client, delete files (sRaidFrames.lua and sRaidFrames.lua.bak) from SavedVariables folder or whole WTF if you're lazy to find it
- try to disable or reduce numer of buff filters(there are none at default - great number may cause fps drop)
- try to use supported unitframes(Default Blizzard, Luna, AG - Available from https://github.com/satan666/ag_UnitFrames_Improved)
